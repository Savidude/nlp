You can run the following command in the root directory of the project
```pip install requirements.txt```
  4. Run Jupiter Notebook on top of your activated enviroment
  5. You can run any of the ```.ipynb``` files listed inside the project

Every task has been done separately. For example,
```1_pearson_correlation.ipynb```, ```2_cosine_similarity```, ```3_stylistic_classification``` and etc.
